    Hello, I’m Sam Sawchuk.

      I’m a UX Designer and Consultant at <a href="http://www.howeandwye.com">HOWE&WYE</a>.

Understanding people’s needs, lives, and circumstances is at the heart of what I do. It’s not a job—it’s how I operate. At each stage of my career, I’ve broken down barriers and focused on an empathetic human perspective. I’ve had the good fortune to work with many truly amazing startups: At <a href="http://uber.com">Uber</a> back when they only had 900 employees (now over 20K), I talked with driver partners on the streets and brought back real-world insight. At <a href="http://hired.com">Hired</a>, a San Francisco-based startup, I connected with developers and designers around the world, and supported them as they moved into a new career. Hired disrupted the way companies hire technical talent. At <a href="http://hired.com">Tembo Education</a>, a Boston-based startup, I worked with children and parents from Nigeria, and built a curriculum around their needs. Tembo was named to the Forbes list of “30under30.” At <a href="http://ayogo.com">Ayogo Health</a>, a Vancouver-based health system, I collaborated with patient groups, and together we defined their needs. Ayogo was twice named one of the “Top 100 mHealth Companies in the World,” and many more!

After working with so many interesting creatives, I decided to capture some of their stories. I launched what became a recognized resource for understanding how over 200 global innovators, creators, and entrepreneurs got to where they are in their career through authentic stories. 

To do this, I created a streamlined process to collect stories, conducted user testing to evaluate usability, information architecture, and cross-platform flows, and ultimately designed and published a book, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/The-Times-I-Thought-It-Was-All-Over-Paperback/178433504?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&adid=22222222227159920114&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=271363714223&wl4=pla-449459144106&wl5=9002557&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=online&wl12=178433504&wl13=&veh=sem">Times I Thought it Was All Over 
</a> in 2018.

In addition to writing, I have spoken on the TEDx stage to deliver, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C5xYstluLs">“Putting a Face on Homelessness: The Power of Starting with Hello.”</a> I have also spoken at multiple tech accelerators like <a href="https://generalassemb.ly>General Assembly</a>, <a href="http://techstars.com">Techstars</a>, <a href="https://masschallenge.org">MassChallenge</a>, and <a href="https://dmz.ryerson.ca">The DMZ</a> where I gave presentations to shift <a href=“https://hired.ca/”>Hired’s</a> brand perception from online tool to thought leader in the technical talent space.  </p>

    	I grew up on Canada’s West Coast and have pretty much always been into creating. I'll tell you about my <b>spark</b> below, but nothing gets me more excited than crystallizing new concepts like <a href="https://angel.co/projects/853524-brandschools?src=user_profile">BrandSchools</a>, <a href="https://angel.co/projects/853523-intheirshoes?src=more_projects">InTheirShoes</a>, <a href="https://angel.co/projects/853730-convostarter?src=more_projects">Convostarter</a> and testing them. I studied at the University of Calgary and have spent over 1000+ hours leaning the fundamentals of Web Development and Product Design at General Assembly.

  So, you’re probably wondering how I got into all this. While working at <a href="https://ayogo.com”>Ayogo</a> in Vancouver, I was part of a team building health technology for patient adherence. Yet as I walked to work each morning, I often saw people living on street with nothing. One day, I struck up a conversation with a man named Jeremy. He told me his sister was a senior partner at a building near where he slept every night. Something in me clicked. As Jeremy was telling his story, I put myself in his shoes. He’d had a relatively normal upbringing. Like my co-founder Evan, he grew up playing football. He was close with his sister and mother, but through a set of difficult circumstances, ended up on the streets. At the time, I felt well-read and up-to-date on the news. But I realized I’d been ignoring someone right in front of me—and it felt like a wake-up call. I decided to dedicate myself to a career that would focus on how we as humans interact, experience, and use different things in our lives. In 2013, I launched Sandwich for a Story to end the stigma of homelessness. In our first 3 years, we hosted over <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BK_ggjpjaMl/“>50 outreach events.</a> 50 outreach events. Our initiative had an astonishing power to connect. Like a chain reaction, all of these meetings and connections flowed from a simple “hello” one afternoon.

    I <b>give back.</b> I serve as a judge for Venture for Canada, and work with recent graduates to help launch their careers in technology.

I <b>connect</b> with users, advocate for their needs, and generate innovative solutions to meet those needs. And it all starts with a friendly, “Hello.”
