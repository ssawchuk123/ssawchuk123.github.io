    Hello, I’m Sam Sawchuk.
    </p>

    <i class="em em-pencil2"></i>
    <p>
      I’m a UX Designer and Consultant at <a href="http://www.howeandwye.com">HOWE&WYE</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
Understanding people’s needs, lives, and circumstances is at the heart of what I do. It’s not a job—it’s how I operate. At each stage of my career since, I’ve broken down barriers and focused on an empathetic human perspective. At <a href="http://uber.com">Uber</a> back when they only had 900 employees (now over 20K), I talked with driver partners on the streets and brought back real-world insight. At <a href="http://hired.com">Hired</a>, a San Francisco-based startup, I connected with developers and designers around the world, and supported them as they moved into a new career. Hired disrupted the way companies hire technical talent. At <a href="http://hired.com">Tembo Education</a>, a Boston-based startup, I worked with children and parents from Nigeria, and built a curriculum around their needs. Tembo was named to the Forbes list of “30under30.” At <a href="http://ayogo.com">Ayogo Health</a>, a Vancouver-based health system, I collaborated with patient groups, and together we defined their needs. Ayogo was twice named one of the “Top 100 mHealth Companies in the World,” and many more.

My passion for connecting with users, advocate for their needs, and generate innovative solutions to meet those needs, extends beyond my daily work.
I launched what became a recognized resource for understanding how over 200 global innovators, creators, and entrepreneurs got to where they are in their career through authentic stories. 

To do this, I created a streamlined process to collect stories, conducted user testing to evaluate usability, information architecture, and cross-platform flows, and ultimately designed and published a book, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/The-Times-I-Thought-It-Was-All-Over-Paperback/178433504?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&adid=22222222227159920114&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=271363714223&wl4=pla-449459144106&wl5=9002557&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=online&wl12=178433504&wl13=&veh=sem">Times I Thought it Was All Over 
</a> in 2018.

    <p>
    In addition to writing, I also speak at design and startup conferences
    around the world. Recently I’ve been talking about
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoEtYLOtqig">Design Culture</a>
    (Slush, 2016), and how teams can create environments where designers
    are productive and happy. I also love talking about
    <a href="https://vimeo.com/188140190">Design Sprints</a>
    (Webdagene, 2016) and
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQl74ARR9RY">Failure</a>
    (Airbnb, 2012).

    Before I began advising startups, I was an early designer at Google.
    I joined the company in 2005 and and led the design of several new
    products including
    <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/">Google for Business</a>,
    <a href="https://www.google.com/sheets/about/">Google Spreadsheets</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a>.
    I also led <a href="https://www.google.com/gmail/about/">Gmail</a>
    design for several years before moving to GV.
    </p>

    <i class="em em-computer"></i>
    <p>
    I grew up in the Midwest and was pretty much always a nerd. I remember
    spending hours upon hours with my
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=TI99">first computer</a>.
    So it’s no surprise I ended up studying Computer Science at the
    <a href="http://cs.uiuc.edu">University of Illinois</a>.
    During my summers I built early virtual reality simulations at the
    <a href="https://beckman.illinois.edu">Beckman Institute</a> and interactive data visualizations at
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucent">Lucent Technologies</a>.
    </p>

    <i class="em em-heart_eyes"></i>
    <p>
    But as much as I enjoyed engineering, my true passion has always been making
    things for other people. So I decided to move into the field of design
    by attending the <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/">Human-Computer Interaction</a> graduate program at
    Carnegie Mellon. It’s been a fantastic journey ever since.
    </p>

    <p>
    If I’m not thinking about design, I’m probably thinking about
    backpacking. My favorite trips have been to
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BLlyEybB2WM/">Iceland</a>,
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/qrNrNxwFoz/">Rae Lakes</a>,
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BF-IvsUwFtm/">Desolation Wilderness</a>,
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_7cuN0wFku/">Cone Peak</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BLaV1jwh_KH/">the Minarets</a>.
    This world is too amazing not to explore!
